AI Memento Project
Project Overview

AI Memento is an intelligent, interactive AI assistant that can remember past interactions and provide personalized responses based on user memory. Unlike regular chatbots that respond statically, AI Memento maintains a memory of previous conversations, allowing for more context-aware and human-like interactions.

This project demonstrates practical applications of AI in natural language processing (NLP), memory management, and conversational AI, making it an excellent showcase for skills in Python, AI, and software design.

Key Features

Memory-Based Interaction

The AI can remember user input across multiple sessions.

It uses a memory.json file to store past conversations.

Users experience more personalized and context-aware responses.

Interactive Chat

Users can chat with the AI through a simple command-line interface.

AI responds intelligently using LLaMA (or other AI models) as the backend.

Persistent Data

Memory is saved locally, enabling long-term learning from user interactions.

This allows the AI to recall information about the user even after restarting the program.

Modular Design

Easy-to-understand code structure:

agent.py → Handles AI responses and user interactions.

memory.py → Handles storing and retrieving user memories.

Modular design makes it easy to extend functionality.

Customizable AI Personality

Personality traits and response styles can be modified in the code.

This allows developers to experiment with different AI behaviors.

How It Works

Memory Initialization

When the AI starts, it loads a JSON file containing previous conversations.

Example: memory = Memory("memory.json")

User Interaction

User inputs text via command line:

user_input = input("You: ")
response = agent.chat(user_input)
print("AI:", response)


Memory Update

After each response, the AI updates its memory file to include new interactions.

Memory management ensures personalized, contextual responses in future chats.

AI Model

The AI uses LLaMA as the language model backend.

Model interprets the input, considers memory, and generates relevant responses.

Skills Demonstrated

Python Programming – Modular coding and file handling.

AI & NLP – Conversational AI using LLaMA.

Conclusion

The AI Memento Project demonstrates how conversational AI can be enhanced with memory to create more personalized, context-aware interactions. By combining natural language processing, persistent memory storage, and modular Python programming, this project showcases practical skills in AI development and software design.

This project is a great example of applying AI to real-world problems, such as virtual assistants, customer support, and educational tools. It not only highlights technical expertise but also the ability to design systems that learn and adapt over time, making it an impressive addition to any portfolio or resume.
